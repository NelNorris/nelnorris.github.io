# hugbox
Pursuing independent learning in code. And hugging myself with glee. Hee hee hee.
In particular, I wanted to create a gallery that was easy to navigate, using jQuery. I have used my artwork from a 365 doodle from way back in 2014 (so long ago!). Yes, some of the pictures do make me cringe a bit, but some don't so much. I have also used Bootstrap to lay things out because I like it; I'm afraid it rather reminds me of designing and building pages in the early 2000s using tables. I'm afraid both methods appeal to me because I have an irrational fear of the CSS position attribute properties.
